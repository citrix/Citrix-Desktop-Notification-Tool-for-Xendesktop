# Citrix-Desktop-Notification-Tool-for-Xendesktop

What is it
----------
Administrators monitoring XenDesktop have to be logged into Director console or keep checking mails regularly for any 
possible critical alerts that might affect users of XenDesktop.
Instead Desktop Notification Tool notifies the administrators with desktop notifications  whenever there is a new alert from any of the numerous sites 
for which alert policies/alert rules are configured.
